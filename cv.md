## :pencil2: About Me <br>

All I want is money, that's what I thought until recently. But getting bruised and going through mistakes, I realized that "Money is not the main thing, the main thing is work", because if you need money you need to earn it. It would seem that this is something that everyone already knows, but in fact it is quite difficult to realize.<br><br>
I want to work to provide for my “whole” family (mother, aunt, sister, nephews, etc.), including close friends, to get them out of the “dirty” place they are in - this is a childhood dream for which I'm ready to move mountains.<br><br>
Someone will say, you will stop developing as soon as you get money, this is not true, because the more you know, the more you get, and I need a "very" lot of money. I am ready and will absorb all the information on my way. <br><br>
